-- #1: What are the column names?
SELECT * 
FROM orders 
LIMIT 10;

-- #2: How recent is this data?
SELECT DISTINCT order_date
FROM orders
ORDER BY order_date DESC
LIMIT 5;
-- The latest order date is 2017-06-30.

-- #3: Instead of selecting all the columns using *, write a query that selects only the special_instructions column.
SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
LIMIT 5;

-- #4: Can you edit the query so that we are only returning the special instructions that are not empty?
SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY special_instructions
LIMIT 5;

-- #5: Let’s search for special instructions that have the word ‘sauce’.
SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions IS NOT NULL AND special_instructions LIKE '%sauce%'
ORDER BY special_instructions;

-- #6: Let’s search for special instructions that have the word ‘door’.
SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions IS NOT NULL AND special_instructions LIKE '%door%'
ORDER BY special_instructions;

-- #7: Let’s search for special instructions that have the word ‘box’.
SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions IS NOT NULL AND special_instructions LIKE '%box%'
ORDER BY special_instructions;

-- #8: Instead of just returning the special instructions, also return their order ids. For more readability: Rename id as ‘#’ and rename special_instructions as ‘Notes’
SELECT user_id, id AS '#', special_instructions AS Notes
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions IS NOT NULL AND special_instructions LIKE '%box%'
