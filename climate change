#Climate Change Project
-- To practice window functions

-- 2. Analyse how the average temperature changes over time.
-- Note the syntax for window functions: PARTITION BY is followed by ORDER BY

SELECT state, year, tempc,
       AVG(tempc) OVER (PARTITION BY state ORDER BY year) AS running_average
FROM state_climate

-- 3. Write a query that returns the state, year, temperature and lowest temperature for each state.
-- This returns all the values with the minimum value repeating itself for each state in the lowest_temp column.
-- The lowest temperature is more historic and happens mostly in the 1900s. 

-- Interpretation #1:

SELECT state, year, tempc,
       MIN(tempc) OVER(PARTITION BY state) AS lowest_temp
FROM state_climate
ORDER BY state, tempc

-- Interpretation #2:
-- This instead returns a summary of all the lowest temperatures for each state and its respective year. 

SELECT state, year, tempc,
       MIN(tempc) AS lowest_temp
FROM state_climate
GROUP BY state

-- 4. Write a query that returns the state, year, temperature and highest temperature for each state.
-- Most of the highest temperatures are recorded in the 2000s. 

-- Interpretation #1:

SELECT state, year, tempc,
       MAX(tempc) OVER(PARTITION BY state) AS highest_temp
FROM state_climate
ORDER BY state, tempc DESC

-- Intepretation #2:

SELECT state, year, tempc,
       MAX(tempc) AS lowest_temp
FROM state_climate
GROUP BY state

-- 5.1 Which states and years saw the largest change in temperature?
-- Top result that came out is North Dakota in the year 1952 with a change in temperature of 2.79 degC.
-- LAG() is used to access data in previous rows defined by an offset value. LAG(<column>, offset value, default value)
-- Since no null values are allowed, 0 is specified by the default value which will cause the first data for every state to be tempc itself as tempc - 0 = tempc.
-- We need to remove this value as it will inflate the change in temperature so we filter for where the year is > 1895 which is the first data in each state. 

WITH temp_change AS (
  SELECT state, year, tempc,
ROUND(tempc - LAG(tempc,1,0) OVER (PARTITION BY state ORDER BY year),2) AS change_in_temp
FROM state_climate)

SELECT *
FROM temp_change
WHERE year > 1895
ORDER BY change_in_temp DESC
LIMIT 10

-- 5.2 Is there a particular part of the United States that saw the largest yearly changes in temperature?
-- Mostly northern states, e.g. North Dakota, Minnesota, Montana, Michigan, Wisconsin.

-- 6. Write a query to return a rank of the coldest temperatures on record. Are the coldest ranked years recent or historic? 
-- The coldest years are mostly historic from the 1900s. 

SELECT year, state, tempc, 
       RANK() OVER(ORDER BY tempc) AS coldest_rank
FROM state_climate

-- 7. Do the same but now for the warmest temperatures on record.
-- The warmest years are mostly recent from the 2000s and early 1990s. 
-- Add a DESC to the ORDER BY instead to switch around to warmest temperatures. 

SELECT year, state, tempc, 
       RANK() OVER(ORDER BY tempc DESC) AS coldest_rank
FROM state_climate

-- 8. Write a query that will return the average yearly temperatures in quartiles instead of in rankings for each state.
-- Are the coldest years more recent or historic? 
-- Again, the coldest years mostly historic from the mid 1900s.

SELECT year, state, tempc, 
       NTILE(4) OVER(PARTITION BY state ORDER BY tempc) AS quartile
FROM state_climate

-- 9. Write a query that will return the average yearly temperatures in quintiles (5).
-- Here we are looking at the coldest temperature overall and not by state. 
-- The coldest quintile contains states in the Northern region of USA.

SELECT year, state, tempc, 
       NTILE(5) OVER(ORDER BY tempc) AS quartile
FROM state_climate
