SELECT *
FROM places
LIMIT 10;

SELECT * 
FROM reviews
LIMIT 10;

-- Question 2: If each dollar sign ($) represents $10, how could you find all places that cost $20 or less?
SELECT *
FROM places
WHERE price_point IN ('$', '$$');

-- Question 4: Write a query to do an INNER JOIN on the two tables to show all reviews for restaurants that have at least one review.
SELECT name, average_rating, username, rating, review_date, note
FROM places AS t1
LEFT JOIN reviews AS t2
ON t1.id = t2.place_id
WHERE note IS NULL;

-- Question 8: Write a query using the WITH clause to select all the reviews that happened in 2020. JOIN the places to your WITH query to see a log of all reviews from 2020.
WITH reviews_2020 AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM reviews
  WHERE strftime('%Y', review_date) = '2020'
)

SELECT * FROM places
INNER JOIN reviews_2020
ON places.id = reviews_2020.place_id;

-- Question 9: Write a query that finds the reviewer with the most reviews that are BELOW the average rating for places.
SELECT username, AVG(rating) FROM reviews
GROUP BY username
HAVING AVG(rating) < (SELECT AVG(average_rating) FROM places);

SELECT AVG(average_rating) FROM places
